Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB C++ driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB using
the C++11 or later standard. Download the library, ``mongocxx``,
from `mongocxx.org <https://mongocxx.org/mongocxx-v3/installation/>`__
or set up a runnable project by following our tutorial.

Installation
------------

See `Installing the mongocxx driver <https://mongocxx.org/mongocxx-v3/installation/>`__.

.. _connect-atlas-cxx-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to your
MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/cxx-connection.cpp
   :language: cpp

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature which you can use when
connecting to MongoDB Server v5.0 and later and the C++ driver v3.7 and later.

When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-cxx-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that lacks support for the
{+stable-api+}, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/cxx-connection-no-stable-api.cpp
   :language: cpp

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-cxx-driver>` code
example and run it.
