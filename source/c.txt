Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB C driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in C.
Download the required libraries, ``libmongoc`` and ``libbson``,  from
`mongoc.org <https://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html>`__
or set up a runnable project by following our tutorial.

.. _connect-atlas-c-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to your
MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/c-connection.c
   :language: c

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature which you can use when
connecting to MongoDB Server v5.0 and later and the C driver v1.18 and later.

When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-c-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that lacks support for the
{+stable-api+}, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/c-connection-no-stable-api.c
   :language: c

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-c-driver>` code
example and run it.

See `Advanced Connections <https://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/advanced-connections.html>`__
for more ways to connect.
