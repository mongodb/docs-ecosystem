Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Rust driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in
Rust. Download it from `crates.io <https://crates.io/crates/mongodb>`__
or set up a runnable project with examples from our Usage Guide.

- `The Rust Driver Manual <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-rust-driver/manual/>`__

- `API Reference <https://docs.rs/mongodb/latest>`__

- `Changelog <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/releases>`__

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/>`__

Installation
------------

See `Installation <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#Installation>`__

.. _connect-atlas-rust-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the connection snippets in the following tabs to test your
connection to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas. Select from the
:guilabel:`Sync` or :guilabel:`Async` tabs below for corresponding
connection code samples.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Async
      :tabid: rust-async

      .. note::

         The default async runtime used by the driver is ``tokio``. To use a
         different runtime, see
         `Configuring the async runtime <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#configuring-the-async-runtime>`__.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/rust-connection-async.rs
         :language: rust

   .. tab:: Sync
      :tabid: rust-sync

      .. important::

         You must enable the sync API in your application to use the
         synchronous framework. See
         `Enabling the sync API <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#enabling-the-sync-api>`__
         for more details.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/rust-connection-sync.rs
         :language: rust

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature, which you can
enable when using the Rust driver v2.0 and later to connect to MongoDB
Server v5.0 and later. When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see
:manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>` in the Server manual.

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-php-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that doesn't support the
{+stable-api+} feature, you can use the connection snippets in the following
tabs to test your connection to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas. Select from the
:guilabel:`Sync` or :guilabel:`Async` tabs below for corresponding
connection code samples.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Async
      :tabid: rust-async-no-stableapi

      .. note::

         The default async runtime used by the driver is ``tokio``. To use a
         different runtime, see
         `Configuring the async runtime <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#configuring-the-async-runtime>`__.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/rust-connection-no-stableapi-async.rs
         :language: rust

   .. tab:: Sync
      :tabid: rust-sync-no-stableapi

      .. important::

         You must enable the sync API in your application to use the
         synchronous framework. See
         `Enabling the sync API <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#enabling-the-sync-api>`__
         for more details.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/rust-connection-no-stableapi-sync.rs
         :language: rust

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-rust-driver>` code
example and run it.
