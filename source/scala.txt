Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Scala
driver. You can add the driver to your application to work
asynchronously with MongoDB in Scala. Download it using
`sbt <https://www.scala-sbt.org/>`__ or
`Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, or set up a runnable
project by following our tutorials.

- `Reference Documentation <{+java-api+}/driver-scala/>`__

- `Tutorials <{+java-api+}/driver-scala/tutorials/>`__

- `API Documentation <{+java-api+}/apidocs/>`__

- `What's New <{+java-api+}/whats-new/>`__

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/tree/master/driver-scala>`__


Installation
------------

The recommended way to get started using the driver in your project is
with a dependency management system like ``sbt`` or ``maven``. See the
`Installation Guide <{+java-api+}/driver-scala/getting-started/installation/>`__
for more information.

.. _connect-atlas-scala-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to
your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/scala-connection.scala
   :language: scala

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature, which you can
enable when using the Scala driver v4.3 and later to connect to MongoDB Server
v5.0 and later. When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without 
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see
:manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>` in the Server manual.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-scala-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that doesn't support the
{+stable-api+} feature, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/scala-connection-no-stableapi.scala
   :language: scala

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-scala-driver>` code
example and run it.
