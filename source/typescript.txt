Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for official MongoDB TypeScript support.
Since Typescript builds on JavaScript, you can use the
`Node.js Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/>`__
to create TypeScript applications that communicate with MongoDB.

The Node.js Driver started supporting TypeScript with version 4.0. You must
install that version of the driver or a more recent one to use TypeScript.

To learn more about the features and limitations of using TypeScript with the
Node.js Driver, see
`Java Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/typescript/>`__.

Compatibility
-------------

For the compatibility charts for the Node.js Driver, see
`Compatibility <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/compatibility/>`__
in the driver docs.
