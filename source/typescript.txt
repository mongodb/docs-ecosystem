Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for official MongoDB TypeScript support.
Since TypeScript builds on JavaScript, you can use the
`{+node-driver-long+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/>`__
to create TypeScript applications that communicate with MongoDB.

Versions 4.0 and later of the {+node-driver-short+} support TypeScript. You must
install that version of the driver or a more recent one to use TypeScript.

To learn more about the features and limitations of using TypeScript with the
{+node-driver-short+}, see
`TypeScript Fundamentals <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/typescript/>`__
in the Node.js Driver documentation.
