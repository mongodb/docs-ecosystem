Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Python
drivers. Add one of the following drivers to your application to work with
MongoDB in Python:

- :doc:`PyMongo </pymongo>` for synchronous Python applications

  - `PyMongoArrow <https://mongo-arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, a
    PyMongo extension for loading MongoDB query result sets as Apache Arrow tables

- :doc:`Motor </motor>` for asynchronous Python applications

You can connect your application to deployments hosted in the following 
environments:

To learn more about connecting your application to deployments hosted in MongoDB 
Atlas, see :atlas:`Connect from Your Application </driver-connection>`.

Tools and Projects
------------------

- The `Full Stack FastAPI App Generator <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/full-stack-fastapi-mongodb>`__
  simplifies setup of web applications that use the FastAPI, React, and MongoDB
  (FARM) stack. You can learn more about the FARM stack in the
  `MongoDB Developer Center. <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/farm-stack-fastapi-react-mongodb/>`__ 

  .. important::

     The MongoDB Full Stack FastAPI App Generator is an experimental project
     and is not yet supported by MongoDB.
