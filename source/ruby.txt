Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Ruby 
driver. See the :ruby:`official Ruby driver documentation site <>` to learn how
to add the driver to your application.

Object Document Mapper
----------------------

If your application uses validations, associations, and other high-level
data modeling functions, then you may need to install an Object
Document Mapper (ODM). The ODM officially supported by MongoDB is called
Mongoid. See the `Mongoid Manual
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/>`__ to learn how to begin
using the Mongoid ODM.
