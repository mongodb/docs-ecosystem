MongoDB Installer for Windows on Azure
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure is a tool that can be used to
provision a MongoDB into Window Azure Virtual Machines. The installer
provisions the required number of virtual machines, installs MongoDB on them
and if necessary configures the replica set cluster. This installer is to
``only`` be used to create a ``test`` instance/clusters. It is ``not for
production deployments``.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows 7 version to deploy from
- Windows Powershell
- Administrator access to run the setup program and installer
- Node.js v0.8.2
- Windows Azure Command Line Tools v0.6.16

Install and Deploy
------------------

The following are the steps to deploy a replica set using the MongoDB
Installer for Windows Azure:

Install the MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not done so already, download the 
`MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure <http://downloads.mongodb.org/azure/MongoDBInstVM.msi>`_.

Double click ``msi`` and accept the license agreement to complete the
installation.

.. _azure-windows-download-settings-file:

Download Your Publish Settings File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The publish settings file is an xml file containing information about
your subscription. This information is used by the actual script to
create the virtual machine instances in your account. To download the publish
settings file, use the Download PublishSettings start menu item:

``Start -> All Programs -> MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure -> Download PublishSettings``

Sign in with your Windows Live ID credentials when prompted. Remember
the path to where the file was downloaded.

.. _azure-windows-run-mongodb-installer:

Run the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure is a
`PowerShell <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx>`_
script. To install and configure your replica, launch the installer as
an Administrator by right-clicking the following ``Start`` menu option
and selecting ``Run as administrator``:

``Start -> All Programs -> MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure -> MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure``

In the PowerShell window, run the script to configure MongoDB on Azure:

.. code-block:: sh

   .\deploy-mongo.ps1 <node-count> <dns-prefix> <image-name> <password> <location> <pub-settings-file-path> [replica-set-name]

- **node-count**: The number of instances required in the replica set.
  Setting this to ``1`` results in a stand-alone instance being deployed and
  not a replica set

- **dns-prefix**: The DNS prefix that is used in the FQDN of an instance.
  For example, if you specify a DNS prefix of ``myreplicaset``, the FQDN is
  ``myreplicaset.cloudapp.net``.

  - The MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure always deploys to the
    production environment, so the FQDN never uses a GUID (as is used for
    deployments to the staging environment).

  - The DNS prefix is not case-sensitive.

- **image-name**: The name of the VHD image in your Windows Azure
  storage account that will be used to create the virtual machines for
  the replica set.

  - You can specify the name of an existing image, which:

    - Is based on the Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system.

    - It has WinRM enabled with HTTP listener.

    - It is hosted in your current storage account.

  - Alternatively you can specify the name of a new image that the tool will
    create for you in your storage account. If the installer finds no existing
    image with the name you specified, it assumes that you want to
    create a new image and prompts you to confirm before proceeding. The
    new image will meet the requirements listed earlier for an existing
    image. Note that for this option, the name you provide cannot match
    any of the names of existing Windows Azure platform images.

- **password**: The password to the Administrator account on the
  provisioned virtual machines. The same password is used for all
  virtual machines (nodes) in the replica set. The password must
  meet Windows password complexity requirements.

  You use this password when you connect to the virtual machines via
  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to perform system management and
  troubleshooting activities. RDP is enabled on all virtual machines
  provisioned by the MongoDB Installer for Windows Azure.

- **location**: The Windows Azure data center location where your
  virtual machines will be provisioned. Data center locations are
  case-sensitive.

  For example, you might use ``West US`` as a location. If you
  do not know which locations are available for your Windows Azure
  subscription, you can use either of these methods to see a list of
  available locations:

  - Sign in to the management portal on <https://windows.azure.com>,
    click ``New Hosted Service``, and then click ``Choose a Region`` to
    see a list of locations.

  - You can use the ``azure vm location list`` command to display a list
    of available locations. The installer installs the command-line
    tools if they are missing. If you want to install them before you
    run the installer, you can do so with the Windows PowerShell script
    \*setup-iasstool.ps1.

- **pub-settings-file-path**: The path to the publish settings file you
  downloaded earlier.

- **replica-set-name**: Specifies the name of your replica set. The
  default name is ``rs``. This parameter is ignored if node-count is set
  to ``1``, as a single-node deployment is not a replica set.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Question**: Error with unauthorized during deployment as seen below

.. code-block:: sh

   error: The subscription is not authorized for this feature.
   error: vm image create command failed

**Answer**: This usually indicates you do not have access to the virtual machine
program. Can you verify in the new preview portal that "Preview
Features" shows account is active for Virtual machines and Virtual
networks. If you have multiple accounts/subscriptions make sure you
download the right pubsettings file

**Question**: I am seeing a timeout error from the installer

.. code-block:: sh

   Error: connect ETIMEDOUT code: 'ETIMEDOUT', errno: 'ETIMEDOUT', syscall: 'connect'
   Error: connect ETIMEDOUT
   at errnoException (net.js:670:11)
   at Object.afterConnect as oncomplete (net.js:661:19)

**Answer**: This occasionally occurs due to connectivity issues with the Azure
service management server or your actual deployed instances. At this
point the work around is to retry. Working on making this more robust

**Question**: In spite of meeting the
`strong password requirements <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786468(v=ws.10).aspx>`_
the installer fails in the password setting

**Answer**: Ensure you do not have a $ in the password as powershell is parsing
it out as a parameter

**Question**: I am seeing the following error. The location or affinity groups
is invalid. The source image must reside ....

**Answer**: Verify that the location of the image you specified and the
location for the instances you choose on the command line are the same.
