Download and Compile C++ Driver
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. _download-cpp-driver:

Download C++ Driver
-------------------

Driver Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C++ client library can be found at
`<http://dl.mongodb.org/dl/cxx-driver>`_ .

.. note::

   Despite the word 'linux' in the filenames, these files are mostly
   source code and thus should be applicable to all operating systems.

From the Server Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the full MongoDB source code, the driver code is part of
it. This is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo>`_ and also on
the `MongoDB Downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_.

The full server source is quite large, so the tarballs above may be
easier. Also if using the full server source tree, use ``scons
mongoclient`` to build just the client library.

.. _compile-and-link-cpp-driver:

Compile and Link C++ Driver
---------------------------

The C++ driver is included in the MongoDB server source repository, and
can also be downloaded as a separate, "standalone" tarball (See
:ref:`download-cpp-driver`). To compile the "standalone" C++ driver, run the
``scons`` command in the top-level directory of the driver sources, e.g.:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd mongo-cxx-driver-nightly/
   scons

You may wish to compile and link :file:`client/simple_client_demo.cpp` to
verify that everything compiles and links fine.

.. important:: 
   
   The C++ driver requires Boost version 1.45 or greater.

Compile on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the prebuilt library
``````````````````````````

.. code-block:: sh

   cd mongo/client
   g++ simple_client_demo.cpp -lmongoclient -lboost_thread-mt -lboost_filesystem -lboost_program_options

Using mongo_client_lib.cpp instead of a library
```````````````````````````````````````````````

If you have a compatibility problem with the library, include
:file:`mongo_client_lib.cpp` in your project instead. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   g++ -I .. simple_client_demo.cpp mongo_client_lib.cpp -lboost_thread-mt -lboost_filesystem


Compile on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   We tend to test MongoDB with Windows using Visual Studio 2010. 2008
   works, although you may have to tweak settings in some cases.

Include :file:`mongoclient.lib` in your application.

To build :file:`mongoclient.lib`:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons mongoclient

Alternatively, include :file:`client/mongo_client_lib.cpp` in your project.

For Windows, see also:

   - :file:`bson/bsondemo/bsondemo.vcxproj`

   - :file:`client/examples/simple_client_demo.vcxproj`

   - :about:`Prebuilt Boost Libraries <boost-and-windows>`

     - Prebuilt Boost Libraries only necessary for versions < 2.1.1

     - Boost 1.49 source is now included directly in version 2.1.1+

   - :about:`/tutorial/build-mongodb-with-visual-studio-2010`

Other notes for Windows:

- Compile with ``/MT``

- You may wish to define ``_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`` to avoid warnings
  on use of ``strncpy`` and such by the MongoDB client code.

- Include the ``WinSock`` library in your application:
  :menuselection:`Linker --> Input --> Additional Dependencies` - add
  :file:`ws2_32.lib`.

Windows Troubleshooting
```````````````````````

.. code-block:: none

   error LNK2005: ___ already defined in msvcprt.lib(MSVCP100.dll) libboost_thread-vc100-mt-1_42.lib(thread.obj)

The boost library being linked against is expecting a ``/MT`` build. If
this is a release build, try using ``/MT`` instead of ``/MD`` for compilation
(under :menuselection:`Properties-->C++-->Code Generation`).
