A. Create a Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB `Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-client-side-encryption/>`_ uses an encryption strategy called *envelope encryption* in which keys used to encrypt/decrypt data (called **data encryption keys**) are encrypted with another key (called the **master key**). For more information on the features of envelope encryption and key management concepts, see `AWS Key Management Service Concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping>`_.

The master key, used by the MongoDB driver to create and encrypt data keys, should be stored remotely in a `Key Management System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management#Key_management_system>`_. The data encryption keys, generated and used by the MongoDB driver to encrypt and decrypt document fields, are stored in a key vault collection in the same database as the encrypted data.

In this step, we generate a local master key to expedite setup of our development environment.

.. admonition:: Local Master Keys Are Not Secure
   :class: important

   Do not use a local master key in a production environment to ensure that it cannot be compromised. Instead, use a secure KMS such as `AWS KMS <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`_.

   We demonstrate how to transition from a locally-hosted master key to a remote AWS KMS master key in a later step of this guide.

        The following script generates a 96-byte local master key and saves it to a file called ``master-key.txt`` in the directory from which the script is executed.

        .. code-block:: java

          import java.io.FileOutputStream;
          import java.io.IOException;
          import java.security.SecureRandom;

          public class CreateMasterKeyFile {
            public static void main(final String[] args) {

              final byte[] localMasterKey = new byte[96];
              new SecureRandom().nextBytes(localMasterKey);

              try (FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream("master-key.txt")) {
                stream.write(localMasterKey);
              } catch (IOException e)  {
                e.printStackTrace();
              }
            }
          }
