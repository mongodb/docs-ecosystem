Admin UIs
=========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB does not include a GUI-style administrative interface. Instead
most administration is done from command line tools such as the :program:`mongo`
shell. However some UI's are available as separate community projects
and are listed below. Some are focused on administration, while some
focus on data viewing.

  site and it just works!

- Fast AJAX-based XHTML 1.1 interface operates consistently in every
  browser!

- Self-contained in a single 95kb file!

- Works on any version of PHP5 with the MongoDB NoSQL database installed
  & running.

- Super flexible - search for exact-text, text with * wildcards, regex
  or JSON (with MongoDB-operators enabled)

- Option to enable password-protection for one or more users; to
  activate protection, just add the username-password(s) to the array at
  the top of the file.

- E_STRICT PHP code is formatted to the Zend Framework coding standards
  + fully-documented in the phpDocumentor DocBlock standard.

- Textareas can be resized by dragging/stretching the lower-right corner.

- Free & open-source! Release under the GPLv3 FOSS license!

PHP and MongoDB. Download `phpMoAdmin <http://www.phpmoadmin.com/>`_,
place the ``moadmin.php`` file in your web site document directory and
navigate to it in a browser. One of two things will happen:

- You will see an error message explaining why PHP and MongoDB cannot
  connect and what you need to do to fix it

- You will see a bunch of MongoDB-related options, including a selection
  of databases (by default, the ``admin`` and ``local`` databases always
  exist) - if this is the case your installation was successful and your
  problem is within the PHP code that you are using to access MongoDB,
  troubleshoot that from the MongoDB docs on php.net
