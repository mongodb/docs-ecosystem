Admin UIs
=========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB does not include a GUI-style administrative interface. Instead
most administration is done from command line tools such as the :program:`mongo`
shell. However some UI's are available as separate community projects
and are listed below. Some are focused on administration, while some
focus on data viewing.

.. seealso::
   - The `MongoDB Monitoring Service (MMS) <http://www.10gen.com/mongodb-monitoring-service>`_ from 10gen.
   - Tim `Gourley's blog <http://blog.timgourley.com/post/453680012/tuesday-night-tech-mongodb-ui-edition>`_ has a good summary of the tools.

- An interactive console that allows you to either work with the
  database through the UI, or by using custom Javascript.

- A set of simple commands that wrap the Javascript driver, and provide
  an easy way to complete the most common tasks.

- Javascript driver for MongoDB that works on the browser and talks with
  the AJAX interface.

- Simple server-side AJAX interface for communicating with the MongoDB
  server (currently available for PHP).

PHPMoAdmin
~~~~~~~~~~

- `http://www.phpmoadmin.com/`_

PHPMoAdmin is a MongoDB administration tool for PHP built on a
stripped-down version of the Vork high-performance framework.

- Nothing to configure - place the moadmin.php file anywhere on your web
  site and it just works!

- Fast AJAX-based XHTML 1.1 interface operates consistently in every
  browser!

- Self-contained in a single 95kb file!

- Works on any version of PHP5 with the MongoDB NoSQL database installed
  & running.

- Super flexible - search for exact-text, text with * wildcards, regex
  or JSON (with MongoDB-operators enabled)

- Option to enable password-protection for one or more users; to
  activate protection, just add the username-password(s) to the array at
  the top of the file.

- E_STRICT PHP code is formatted to the Zend Framework coding standards
  + fully-documented in the phpDocumentor DocBlock standard.

- Textareas can be resized by dragging/stretching the lower-right corner.

- Free & open-source! Release under the GPLv3 FOSS license!

- Option to query MongoDB using JSON or PHP-array syntax

- Multiple design themes to choose from

- Instructional error messages - phpMoAdmin can be used as a PHP-MongoDB
  connection debugging tool

PHPMoAdmin can help you discover the source of connection issues between
PHP and MongoDB. Download `phpMoAdmin <http://www.phpmoadmin.com/>`_,
place the ``moadmin.php`` file in your web site document directory and
navigate to it in a browser. One of two things will happen:

- You will see an error message explaining why PHP and MongoDB cannot
  connect and what you need to do to fix it

- You will see a bunch of MongoDB-related options, including a selection
  of databases (by default, the ``admin`` and ``local`` databases always
  exist) - if this is the case your installation was successful and your
  problem is within the PHP code that you are using to access MongoDB,
  troubleshoot that from the MongoDB docs on php.net
