most administration is done from command line tools such as the :program:`mongo`
shell. However some UI's are available as separate community projects
and are listed below. Some are focused on administration, while some
focus on data viewing.

  running.

- Super flexible - search for exact-text, text with * wildcards, regex
  or JSON (with MongoDB-operators enabled)

- Option to enable password-protection for one or more users; to
