REST Interfaces
---------------

Eve (Python)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Eve <http://python-eve.org>`_ is an open source Python REST API framework designed for human beings. It
allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured
RESTful Web Services powered by MongoDB.

The codebase is thoroughly tested under Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and PyPy.

All you need to bring your REST Web Service online is a MongoDB database, a 
configuration file and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that configuring 
and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.

- Emphasis on REST
- Full range of CRUD operations
- Customizable resource endpoints
- Customizable, multiple item endpoints
- Filtering and Sorting
- Pagination
- HATEOAS
- JSON and XML Rendering
- Conditional Requests
- Data Integrity and Concurrency Control
- Bulk Inserts
- Data Validation
- Extensible Data Validation
- Resource-level Cache Control
- API Versioning
- Document Versioning
- Authentication
- ... and (a lot) more.

RESTHeart (Java)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`RESTHeart <http://www.restheart.org>`_ REST API server for
MongoDB, built on top of `Undertow <http://undertow.io>`_ non-blocking
HTTP server. License: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

> RESTHeart leverages MongoDB's document-oriented nature, creating an automatic mapping between MongoDB's internal storage of data and a graph of externally accessible HTTP resources, implementing a model of interaction compliant with an HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) representation, where the state of a client process is entirely driven by HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.

- Lightweight and fast server, ready to use without any coding;
- Built on standards, like HTTP, JSON, RESTful, HAL, JSON Schema;
- Pluggable Authentication and Authorization, with ready to use Identity Manager and role-based Access Manager;
- Data operations API, to create, read, update, delete and query documents;
- Support for "dot notation" and update operators on every write verb (new in 2.0);
- Bulk operations, with POST, PATCH and DELETE of multiple documents with one single request (new in 2.0);
- GridFS support, for large binary data;
- Aggregation Operations, for both map-reduce and aggregation pipelines (improved in 2.0);
- Data model operations API, to create dbs, collections and indexes via pure RESTful calls;
- Strict data validation with JSON Schema (new in 2.0);
- WebHooks to call other web resources after request completes (new in 2.0);
- Relationship can be defined so that documents automatically include the hyperlinks to referenced data;
- Transformation and Checks logic can be easily applied to requests;
- Serve Static Resources (such as HTML, CSS, images and JavaScript) and custom Application Logic;
- Supports optimized browser web caching and avoids ghost writes with standard ETag (improved in 2.0);
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS);
- Embedded HAL browser to easily navigate your data.
- Available also as a `Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/softinstigate/restheart/>`
- Ideal as an AngularJS (or any other MVC JavaScript framework) back-end.

HTTP Interfaces
---------------

Sleepy Mongoose (Python)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Sleepy Mongoose <http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/02/22/sleepy-mongoose-a-mongodb-rest-interface/>`_
is a full featured HTTP interface for MongoDB.

HTTP Status Interface
---------------------

.. deprecated:: 3.2

   Starting in 3.2, MongoDB deprecates the HTTP interface.

MongoDB provides a simple HTTP interface listing information of interest
to administrators. If you enable the interface with the ``--rest``
option to :program:`mongod`, you may access it via a port that is
1000 more than the configured :program:`mongod` port. The default
port for the HTTP interface is ``28017``. To access the HTTP interface an
administrator may, for example, point a browser to
``http://localhost:28017`` if :program:`mongod` is running with the default port on the
local machine.

.. image:: /figures/http-interface-console.png

Here is a description of the informational elements of the HTTP
interface:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **element**
     - **description**
   * - db version
     - database version information
   * - git hash
     - database version developer tag
   * - sys info
     - :program:`mongod` compilation environment
   * - dblocked
     - indicates whether the primary :program:`mongod` mutex is held
   * - uptime
     - time since this :program:`mongod` instance was started
   * - assertions
     - any software assertions that have been raised by this :program:`mongod` instance
   * - replInfo
     - information about replication configuration
   * - currentOp
     - most recent client request
   * - # databases
     - number of databases that have been accessed by this :program:`mongod` instance
   * - curclient
     - last database accessed by this :program:`mongod` instance
   * - Cursors
     - describes outstanding client cursors
   * - master
     - whether this :program:`mongod` instance has been designated a master
   * - slave
     - whether this :program:`mongod` instance has been designated a slave
   * - initialSyncCompleted
     - whether this slave or repl pair node has completed an initial
       clone of the :program:`mongod` instance it is replicating
   * - DBTOP
     - Displays the total time the :program:`mongod` instance has devoted to each
       listed collection, as well as the percentage of available time
       devoted to each listed collection recently and the number of
       reads, writes, and total calls made recently
   * - dt
     - Timing information about the primary :program:`mongod` mutex

HTTP Status Interface Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Ensure that the HTTP status interface, the REST API, and
   the JSON API are all disabled in production environments to prevent
   potential data exposure and vulnerability to attackers.

   See :ref:`Security and MongoDB API Interfaces <http-interface-security>`

If security is configured for a :program:`mongod` instance,
authentication is required for a client to access the HTTP status interface
from another machine.

.. note::

   While MongoDB Enterprise does support Kerberos authentication,
   Kerberos is not supported by the HTTP status interface in any
   version of MongoDB.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   Neither the HTTP status interface nor the REST API support the
   :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>` challenge-response
   user authentication mechanism introduced in version 3.0.

Simple REST API
---------------

The :program:`mongod` process includes a simple REST API as a convenience. With no support for
insert, update, or remove operations, it is generally used
for monitoring, alert scripts, and administrative tasks. For full REST
capabilities, consider using an external :ref:`REST Interface <rest-interface>` such as
`Sleepy.Mongoose <http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/02/22/sleepy-mongoose-a-mongodb-rest-interface/>`_.

**v1.4+**: This API is disabled by default, as it could provide unauthenticated access to data.
Use ``--rest`` on the command line to enable, but be aware of security implications.

To get the contents of a collection (note the trailing slash):

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/

To add a limit:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?limit=-10

To skip:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?skip=5

To query for ``{a : 1}``:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?filter_a=1

Separate conditions with an ``&``:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://127.0.0.1:28017/databaseName/collectionName/?filter_a=1&limit=-10

Same as ``db.$cmd.findOne({listDatabase:1})`` on the ``admin`` database
in the shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://localhost:28017/admin/$cmd/?filter_listDatabases=1&limit=1

To count documents in a collection:

.. code-block:: sh

   http://host:port/db/$cmd/?filter_count=collection&limit=1

JSON in the simple REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simple REST API uses strict JSON (as opposed to the shell,
which uses Dates, regular expressions, etc.). To display non-JSON types,
the web interface wraps them in objects and uses the key for the type.
For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   # ObjectIds just become strings
   "_id" : "4a8acf6e7fbadc242de5b4f3"

   # dates
   "date" : { "$date" : 1250609897802 }

   # regular expressions
   "match" : { "$regex" : "foo", "$options" : "ig" }

The code type has not been implemented yet and causes the DB to crash if
you try to display it in the browser.

See :manual:`Mongo Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>`
for details.

Replica Set Admin UI
--------------------

The :program:`mongod` process includes a simple administrative UI for checking the
status of a replica set.

To use, first enable ``--rest`` from the :program:`mongod` command line. The rest port
is the db port plus 1000 (thus, the default is ``28017``). Be sure this port
is secure before enabling this.

Then you can navigate to ``http://<hostname>:28017/`` in your web
browser. Once there, click Replica Set Status
(`/_replSet <http://127.0.0.1:28017/_replSet>`_) to move to the Replica
Set Status page.
