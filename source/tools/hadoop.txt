The MongoDB Connector for Hadoop is a plugin for Hadoop that provides
the ability to use MongoDB as an input source and/or an output destination.

The source code is available on `Github
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop>`_ where you can find a more
comprehensive `wiki
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/wiki>`_.

If you have questions, submit them to our
:community-forum:`MongoDB Community Forums </>`.

For any issues please file a ticket in :issue:`Jira <HADOOP>`.

This guide also includes the following documentation:

- :doc:`/tutorial/getting-started-with-hadoop`

- :doc:`/use-cases/hadoop`

Installation
------------

#. Obtain the Hadoop connector.  You may either download the JARs from the
   `Maven Central Repository
   <http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/>`_ or `build it
   yourself
   <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/blob/master/README.md#building>`_.
   The JARs are universal and will work with any version of Hadoop.

#. Obtain a JAR for the `MongoDB Java Driver <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/?jmp=docs>`_.
#. Move these JARs onto each node of the Hadoop cluster.
   You may provision each node so that the jars are somewhere on Hadoop's `CLASSPATH`
   (e.g. ``$HADOOP_PREFIX/share/hadoop/common``), or you can use the Hadoop
   `DistributedCache <http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/filecache/DistributedCache.html>`_
   to move the JARs onto pre-existing nodes.

For more complete install instructions, please see the installation instructions
for your platform on the `Hadoop Connector wiki <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/wiki>`_.
