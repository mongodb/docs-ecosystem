MongoDB Connector for Hadoop

The MongoDB Connector for Hadoop is a plugin for Hadoop that provides
the ability to use MongoDB as an input source and/or an output source.

The source code is available on `github
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop>`_ where you can find a more
comprehensive `readme
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/blob/master/README.md>`_.

If you have questions please email the `mongodb-user Mailing List
<http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user>`_. For any issues please
file a ticket in `Jira <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HADOOP>`_.

This guide also includes the following documentation:

- :doc:`/tutorial/getting-started-with-hadoop`

- :doc:`/use-cases/hadoop`

Installation
------------

The MongoDB Connector for Hadoop uses the `SBT Build Tool
<https://github.com/harrah/xsbt>`_ tool for compilation. SBT provides
superior support for discrete configurations targeting multiple Hadoop
versions. The distribution includes self-bootstrapping copy of SBT in
the distribution as ``sbt``. Create a copy of the jar files using the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./sbt package

The MongoDB Connector for Hadoop supports a number of Hadoop releases. You
can change the Hadoop version supported by the build by modifying the
value of ``hadoopRelease`` in the :file:`build.sbt` file. For instance, set
this value to:

.. code-block:: none

   hadoopRelease in ThisBuild := "cdh3"

configures a build against Cloudera CDH3u3.

While:

.. code-block:: none

   hadoopRelease in ThisBuild := "0.21"

configures a build against Hadoop 0.21 from the mainline Apache
distribution.

After building, you will need to place the "core" jar and the
``mongo-java-driver`` in the ``lib`` directory of each Hadoop server.

For more complete install instructions please see the `install
instructions in the readme
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-hadoop/blob/master/README.md#building-the-adapter>`_
