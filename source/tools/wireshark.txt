Wireshark Support for MongoDB Protocol
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

`Wireshark <http://www.wireshark.org/>`_, an advanced interactive network
traffic sniffer, has `full support <http://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo>`_
for the MongoDB Wire protocol.

You can visually inspect MongoDB traffic, do complex filters on specific
values of MongoDB wire messages, and dig into individual documents both
sent and received.

Wireshark looks for port ``27017`` and infers MongoDB protocol from this. If
you are running on a different port number, go to
Preferences...Protocols...Mongo and set your port number, and it should
then interpret the data.
