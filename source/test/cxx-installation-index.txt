Package Managers
----------------

The Mongo C++ driver is available in the following package managers.


* `Vcpkg <https://vcpkg.io/>`__ (search for mongo-cxx-driver)
* `Conan <https://conan.io/center/recipes/mongo-cxx-driver>`__
* `Homebrew <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mongo-cxx-driver>`__

Vcpkg Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not already have Vcpkg installed, install it with the following
command:

.. code-block::

   $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
   $ cd vcpkg
   $ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

Optionally, to install with Visual Studio integration:

.. code-block::

   vcpkg integrate install

Install the driver. (You may need to ``git pull`` to get the latest version of the
driver)

.. code-block::

   $ ./vcpkg install mongo-cxx-driver

You can use the toolchain file, ``vcpkg.cmake``\ , to instruct CMake where to find
the development files, for example:

.. code-block::

   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/<path to vcpkg repo>/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

You can find the header files in:

.. code-block::

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/include/

The library files are in:

.. code-block::

   vcpkg/installed/<CPU ARCHITECTURE>-<OPERATING SYSTEM>/lib/

Conan Install Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package Specifier: ``mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0``

If you do not already have Conan installed, then install it and run the Conan
initalization command below:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install conan
   $ conan profile detect --force

Add the following to your ``conanfile.txt``

.. code-block::

   [requires]
   mongo-cxx-driver/3.8.0
   [generators]
   CMakeDeps
   CMakeToolchain

Install the driver via Conan, and build your project:

.. code-block::

   $ conan install conanfile.txt --output-folder=build --build=missing
   $ cmake \
       -B build \
       -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   $ cmake --build build
