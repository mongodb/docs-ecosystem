Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for PyMongo, the official MongoDB
driver for synchronous Python applications. Download it using
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__
or set up a runnable project by following our tutorial.

.. tip::

   If you need to access MongoDB in a non-blocking manner or from
   co-routines, we recommend that you use the :doc:`Motor </motor>`
   driver instead.

- `Tutorial <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html>`__
  on how to connect to MongoDB and run common operations.

- `API Reference <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/index.html>`__

- `Changelog <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html>`__

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver>`__

Installation
------------

You must install the PyMongo driver module to make it available to your
Python application. We recommend using
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ to install PyMongo.

The following command demonstrates how you can install the latest
version of the module using the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install 'pymongo[srv]'

If you need to install a specific version of ``pymongo``, specify the
version in your command. The following command shows how you can use
``pip`` to install PyMongo version ``3.11``:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install 'pymongo[srv]'==3.11

If you already have PyMongo installed and need to upgrade to the latest
version, use the following ``pip`` command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install --upgrade 'pymongo[srv]'

See `Installation <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__
for more ways to install PyMongo.

.. _connect-atlas-pymongo-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/atlas-connect-blurb.rst

.. code-block:: python

   import pymongo

   # Replace the uri string with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   conn_str = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

   # set a 5-second connection timeout
   client = pymongo.MongoClient(conn_str, serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000)

   try:
       print(client.server_info())
   except Exception:
       print("Unable to connect to the server.")

.. include:: /includes/serverless-compatibility.rst

If the connection succeeds before a five-second timeout, you will see a
dictionary containing information about the server you connected to.

If the connection fails, you should see the following message:

.. code-block:: console
   :copyable: false

   Unable to connect to the server.

For more information on the connection string, see the MongoDB Server
Manual entry on :manual:`Connection String URI Format </reference/connection-string/>`.

{+stable-api+}
--------------

You can use the {+stable-api+} feature starting with MongoDB Server version
5.0 and PyMongo Driver version 3.12. When you use the {+stable-api+} feature,
you can update your driver or server without worrying about backward
compatibility issues with any commands covered by the {+stable-api+}.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

To use this feature, construct a MongoDB client instance, specifying a version
of the {+stable-api+}:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/stable-api-snippets/pymongo-client.py
   :language: python

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-pymongo-driver>`
code example and run it.
