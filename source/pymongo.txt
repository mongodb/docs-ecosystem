Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for PyMongo, the official MongoDB
driver for synchronous Python applications. Download it using
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__
or set up a runnable project by following our tutorial.

.. tip::

   If you need to access MongoDB in a non-blocking manner or from
   co-routines, we recommend that you use the :doc:`Motor </motor>`
   driver instead.

- `Tutorial <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html>`__
  on how to connect to MongoDB and run common operations.

- `API Reference <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/index.html>`__

- `Changelog <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html>`__

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver>`__

You can use the PyMongo driver to connect to deployments hosted in the
following environments:

.. include:: /includes/university-m220p.rst

Installation
------------

You must install the PyMongo driver module to make it available to your
Python application. We recommend using
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ to install PyMongo.

PyMongo requires `dnspython <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython>`__  to support
``mongodb+srv://`` connection strings and `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud>`__. ``dnspython`` is automatically installed
when installing or upgrading to the latest PyMongo version.

The following command demonstrates how you can install the latest
version of the module using the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongo

If you need to install a specific version of PyMongo, specify the
version in your command. The following command shows how you can use
``pip`` to install PyMongo version ``3.11``:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongo==3.11

If you already have PyMongo installed and need to upgrade to the latest
version, use the following ``pip`` command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install --upgrade pymongo

See `Installation <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__
for more ways to install PyMongo.

.. _connect-atlas-pymongo-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to
your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/pymongo-connection.py
   :language: python

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature, which you can
enable when using the PyMongo driver v3.12 and later to connect to MongoDB Server
v5.0 and later. When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see
:manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>` in the Server manual.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-pymongo-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that doesn't support the
{+stable-api+} feature, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/pymongo-connection-no-stableapi.py
   :language: python

Connect to MongoDB Atlas from AWS Lambda
----------------------------------------

To learn how to connect to Atlas from AWS Lambda, see the
`Manage Connections with AWS Lambda <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/manage-connections-aws-lambda/>`__
documentation.

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-pymongo-driver>`
code example and run it.

Compatibility
-------------

.. important:: Supported PyMongo and Python Versions
   
   MongoDB does not support any Python driver versions earlier than v4.0
   or any Python versions earlier than v3.6.
