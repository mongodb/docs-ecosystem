Stand-alone Libraries
---------------------

- `Doctrine MongoDB ODM <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm>`_ is a library
  that provides object mapping functionality for MongoDB. Integrations with
  `Symfony <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle>`_ and
  `Laminas <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule>`_ (formerly Zend
  Framework) are also available.

- `Mongo PHP Adapter <https://github.com/alcaeus/mongo-php-adapter>`_ is a
  userland library designed to act as an adapter between applications relying on
  the legacy ``mongo`` extension and the new ``mongodb`` extension. It provides
  the API of the legacy driver on top of the new driver and library, which
  allows for compatibility with PHP 7.

- `Mongolid <https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/mongolid>`_: A fast ODM for PHP and
  MongoDB, which implements both ActiveRecord and DataMapper design patterns and
  supports embedded and referenced documents. An integration with
  `Laravel <https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/mongolid-laravel>`__ is also available.

- `Xenus <https://github.com/abellion/xenus>`_ is an elegant MongoDB ODM
  that supports events, relationships, embedded documents, and more. An
  integration with `Laravel <https://github.com/abellion/xenus-laravel>`__ is
  also available, which adds support for failed jobs, migrations, and events.
