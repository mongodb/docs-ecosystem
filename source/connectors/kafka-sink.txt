Apache Kafka uses a sink connector to consume records from a topic and
save the data to a datastore.

This guide [ TODO: explain the coverage of this guide ]

MongoDB Persistence
-------------------

The MongoDB Kafka Sink Connector reads Kafka records from one or more
topics, converts them to BSON, and inserts them into the target MongoDB
collection.

Inserts are handled by the WriteModel specified by the write model strategy
and can be either
`ReplaceOneModel
<http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOneModel.html>`_

or

`UpdateOneModel
<http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOneModel.html>`_


will be used whenever inserts or updates are handled. Either model will perform
an upsert if the data does not exist in the collection.

If the connector is configured to process convention-based deletes, then when
``null`` values for Kakfa records are discovered a `DeleteOneModel
<http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteOneModel.html>`_
will be used.

Data is written using the configured write concern level of the connection as
specified in the `connection string
<http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`_.
If the bulk write fails (totally or partially) errors are logged and a simple
retry logic is in place.
