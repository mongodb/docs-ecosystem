Find Something to Help With
---------------------------

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

You can choose a bug on `JIRA <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PERL>`_
and fix it. Make a comment that you are working on it, to avoid overlap.

Write Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~

We would be grateful for any and all tests people would like to write.

Add Features

If you think a feature is missing from the driver, check on IRC or the
mailing list, then go ahead and create a JIRA case and add the feature.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

The best way to make changes is to create an account on
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, fork the
`Perl driver <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-perl-driver>`_,
make your improvements, and submit a merge request.

To make sure your changes are approved and to speed things along:

- Write tests. Lots of tests.

- Document your code.

- Write POD, when applicable.

Bonus (for C programmers, particularly):

- Make sure your change works on Perl 5.8, 5.10, etc. and Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
