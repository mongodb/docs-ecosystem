MongoDB C# / .NET Driver
------------------------

The MongoDB C# Driver is the 10gen-supported C# / .NET driver for
MongoDB.

.. note::
   Several :ref:`other <csharp-community-projects>` C# drivers have been
   developed by the community. This is the "official" C# Driver
   supported by 10gen. It is similar in many ways to the various
   drivers that came before it, but it is *not* a direct replacement
   for any of them. Most people have found it easy to convert to using
   this driver, but you should expect to have to make some
   changes.

Downloading the Driver
----------------------

The C# Driver is hosted at `github.com
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver>`_. Instructions for
downloading the source code are at :ref:`Download Instructions
<csharp-driver-tutorial-downloading>`

You can also download binary builds in either ``.msi`` and ``.zip``
formats from
`<http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/downloads>`_

.. note::
   If you download the ``.zip`` file Windows might require you to
   "Unblock" the help file. If Windows asks "Do you want to open this
   file?" when you double click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm`
   file, clear the check box next to "Always ask before opening this
   file" before pressing the Open button. Alternatively, you can right
   click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm` file and select
   ``Properties``, and then press the ``Unblock`` button at the bottom
   of the ``General`` tab. If the ``Unblock`` button is not present
   then the help file does not need to be unblocked.

Visual Studio Versions Supported
--------------------------------

The current version of the C# Driver has been built and tested using

- Visual Studio 2010

- Visual Studio 2008

Questions and Bug Reports
-------------------------

Questions about the C# driver (or any other MongoDB topic) can be
posted at the `mongodb-user Google Group
<https://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user>`_.

Bug reports can be created in JIRA at
