This is an overview of the available tools for using Scala with
MongoDB. Those wishing to skip to more detailed discussion should check
out the `Mongo Scala Driver Tutorial <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-scala-driver/1.0/getting-started/>`_.


Mongo Scala Driver
------------------

The `Mongo Scala Driver <http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-scala-driver>`_ is the officially supported Scala driver for MongoDB.
It's a modern idiomatic Scala driver with asynchronous and non-blocking IO.

Casbah
------

`Casbah <http://github.com/mongodb/casbah>`_ is the legacy Scala driver for MongoDB.
It provides wrappers and extensions to the
:doc:`Java Driver </drivers/java>`
meant to allow a more Scala-friendly interface to MongoDB.
It supports serialization/deserialization of common Scala types (including
collections and regex), Scala collection versions of DBObject and
DBList and a fluid query DSL.

- `Reactive-Mongo <http://reactivemongo.org/>`_ a reactive driver that
  allows you to design very scalable applications unleashing MongoDB
  capabilities like streaming infinite live collections and files for
  modern Realtime Web applications.

  - `Blog post <http://stephane.godbillon.com/2012/08/30/reactivemongo-for-casbah-unleashing-mongodb-streaming-capabilities-for-realtime-web>`_

- `Tepkin <http://jeroenr.github.io/tepkin/>`_ a reactive driver built on top of Akka.io and Akka Streams that
  has a powerful DSL to easily create MongoDB records. It allows you to design very scalable applications by 
  asynchronously inserting and retrieving (infinite) streams of data with non-blocking backpressure directly into 
  respectively out of MongoDB through Akka streams.

- `frontlets <https://github.com/riedelcastro/frontlets>`_ lightweight
  typed wrappers around Scala maps, with strong mongo support and JSON
  integration. Supports type-safe queries in spirit of the original
  mongo collection interface, object graph traversal, immutable
  objects among other features.

- `Subset2 <https://github.com/osinka/subset2>`_ MongoDB document
  parser combinators and builders for use with the Java driver.

- `Hammersmith <https://github.com/bwmcadams/hammersmith>`_ is a
  Scala-based, asynchronous Netty driver for MongoDB with type-class
  based fast custom object encoding.

- `Salat <https://github.com/novus/salat/>`_ is a simple serialization
  library for case classes. Leverages MongoDB's DBObject
  (which uses BSON underneath) as its target format. Salat is focused
  on fostering a DWIM and intuitive usage pattern for the end-user's
  benefit, without sacrificing run time performance.

- `Blue Eyes <http://github.com/jdegoes/blueeyes>`_ is a lightweight
  framework for building REST APIs with strong MongoDB integration
  including a DSL and Mock MongoDB for testing.

- `Lift Web Framework <http://liftweb.net/>`_ supports MongoDB through
  `Lift-MongoDB <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/MongoDB>`_
  and object mapping via the
  `Record <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Record>`_ back-end
  implementation.

- `Mssd (MongoDB Synchronous Scala Driver)
  <http://www.webpageanalyse.com/dev/mssd>`_ is a synchronous Scala
  driver which wraps the plain old java driver with a more elegant
  scala friendly API. Mssd focuses on simplicity of use with not too
  much magic involved.

- `Mongolia <https://github.com/nilskp/mongolia>`_ is a type-safe Scala
  DSL, based on the v2.+ Java driver. It enforces type-safety by implicitly
  converting non-BSON values to BSON, fully configurable. It also bypasses
  the Java drivers' UUID bug by storing UUIDs as type 4 Binary.
