Scala MongoDB Driver
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

`Casbah <http://github.com/mongodb/casbah>`_ is the officially supported
Scala driver for MongoDB.
It provides wrappers and extensions to the
:doc:`Java Driver </drivers/java>`
meant to allow a more Scala-friendly interface to MongoDB.
It supports serialization/deserialization of common Scala types (including
collections and regex), Scala collection versions of DBObject and
DBList and a fluid query DSL.
