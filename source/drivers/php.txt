Access MongoDB from PHP
-----------------------

To access MongoDB from PHP you need:

- The MongoDB server running. The server is the ":program:`mongod`" file,
  not the ":program:`mongo`" client (note the "d" at the end).

- The MongoDB PHP driver installed.

Install the PHP Driver
----------------------

\*NIX
~~~~~

Run:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo pecl install mongo

Open your ``php.ini`` file and add to it:

.. code-block:: sh

   extension=mongo.so

It is recommended to add this to the section with the other
"extensions," but it will work from anywhere within the ``php.ini`` file.

Restart your web server (Apache, nginx, etc.) for the change to take
effect.

See the `installation docs <http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php>`_
for configuration information and OS-specific installation instructions.

.. note:: ``pecl`` requires that `pear <http://pear.php.net/>`_
   be installed. For those using apt-get, you may need to run the
   following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-cli php-pear

Windows
~~~~~~~

- Download the correct driver for your environment from
  <https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivers.mongodb.org/php/index.html>.
  Thread safe builds are used when running PHP as an Apache module (typical
  installation); non-thread safe builds, which include "nts" in the filename,
  are used for CGI.

- Unzip and add the appropriate ``php_mongo.dll`` file to your PHP extensions
  directory (usually the ``ext`` folder in your PHP installation).

- Add to your ``php.ini``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     extension=php_mongo.dll

- Restart your web server (Apache, IIS, etc.) for the change to take effect.

For more information, see the
`Windows section of the installation docs <http://us3.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php>`_.

Using the PHP Driver
--------------------

To get started, see the `Tutorial <http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongo.tutorial.php>`_
and the `API Documentation <http://us2.php.net/mongo>`_.
