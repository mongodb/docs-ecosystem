MongoDB C# / .NET Driver
------------------------

The MongoDB C# Driver is the officially supported C# / .NET driver for
MongoDB.

- `Source Code <http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/tree/master>`_

.. note:: Several :ref:`other <csharp-community-projects>` C# drivers
   have been developed by the community. This is the "officially
   supported MongoDB" C# Driver. It is similar in many ways to the
   various drivers that came before it, but it is *not* a direct
   replacement for any of them. Most people have found it easy to
   convert to using this driver, but you should expect to have to make
   some changes.

Downloading the Driver
----------------------

The simplest way to get started is by using the nuget package.  The
`package page <http://www.nuget.org/packages/mongocsharpdriver/>`_
will provide details on using nuget.

The C# Driver is hosted at `github.com
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver>`_. Instructions for
downloading the source code are at :ref:`Download Instructions
<csharp-driver-tutorial-downloading>`

You can also download binary builds in either ``.msi`` and ``.zip``
formats from
`<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases>`_

.. note::
   If you download the ``.zip`` file, Windows might require you to
   "Unblock" the help file. If Windows asks "Do you want to open this
   file?" when you double click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm`
   file, clear the check box next to "Always ask before opening this
   file" before pressing the Open button. Alternatively, you can right
   click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm` file and select
   ``Properties``, and then press the ``Unblock`` button at the bottom
   of the ``General`` tab. If the ``Unblock`` button is not present
   then the help file does not need to be unblocked.
