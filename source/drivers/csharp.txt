.. note::
   Several :ref:`other <csharp-community-projects>` C# drivers have been
   developed by the community. This is the "official" C# Driver
   supported by 10gen. It is similar in many ways to the various
   drivers that came before it, but it is *not* a direct replacement
   for any of them. Most people have found it easy to convert to using
   this driver, but you should expect to have to make some
   changes.

Downloading the Driver
----------------------

The simplest way to get started is by using the nuget package.  The 
`package page <http://www.nuget.org/packages/mongocsharpdriver/>`_ 
will provide details on using nuget. 

The C# Driver is hosted at `github.com
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver>`_. Instructions for
downloading the source code are at :ref:`Download Instructions
<csharp-driver-tutorial-downloading>`

You can also download binary builds in either ``.msi`` and ``.zip``
formats from
`<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/releases>`_

.. note::
   If you download the ``.zip`` file Windows might require you to
   "Unblock" the help file. If Windows asks "Do you want to open this
   file?" when you double click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm`
   file, clear the check box next to "Always ask before opening this
   file" before pressing the Open button. Alternatively, you can right
   click on the :file:`CSharpDriverDocs.chm` file and select
   ``Properties``, and then press the ``Unblock`` button at the bottom
   of the ``General`` tab. If the ``Unblock`` button is not present
   then the help file does not need to be unblocked.
