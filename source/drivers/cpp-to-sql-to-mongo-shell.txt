SQL to ``mongo`` Shell to C++
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB queries are expressed as JSON (`BSON`_) objects. This quick
reference chart shows examples as SQL, :program:`mongo` shell syntax,
and MongoDB C++ driver syntax.

A query expression in MongoDB (and other things, such as an index key
pattern) is represented as BSON. In C++ you can use ``BSONObjBuilder``
(aka ``bson::bob``) to build BSON objects, or the ``BSON()`` macro. The
examples below assume a connection ``c`` already established:

.. code-block:: cpp

   using namespace bson;
   DBClientConnection c;
   c.connect("somehost");

.. _`BSON`: http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/bson/

Several of the C++ driver methods throw `mongo::DBException`_, so you
will want a try/catch statement as some level in your program. Also be
sure to call ``c.getLastError()`` after writes to check the error code.
