Third-party Perl Drivers
------------------------

Mango
~~~~~

`Mango <https://metacpan.org/module/Mango>`_ is a pure-Perl, non-blocking,
asynchronous driver for MongoDB, designed to work with the Mojolicious web framework.
Created by Sebastian Riedel.

Object-Document Mappers
-----------------------

Meerkat
~~~~~~~

`Meerkat <https://metacpan.org/module/Meerkat>`_ lets you manage MongoDB documents
as Moose objects. Your objects represent projections of the document state maintained in the database.
Meerkat is designed for atomic operations that keep client-side objects in sync with
the database. Created by David Golden.

MongoDB::Simple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB::Simple <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB::Simple>`_ is
a basic object-to-document mapping system with few dependencies. Created
by Ian Kent.

Mongoose
~~~~~~~~

`Mongoose <https://metacpan.org/module/Mongoose>`_ is an attempt to
bring together the full power of Moose with MongoDB. It provides a full suite
of object-to-document mapping facilities. Created by Rodrigo
de Oliveira Gonzalez.

MongoDBI
~~~~~~~~

`MongoDBI <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBI>`_ is an
Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. It allows you to create
Moose-based classes to interact with MongoDB databases.

MongoDBI allows you to easily model classes while leveraging
the power of MongoDB's schema-less and expeditious document-based design,
dynamic queries, and atomic modifier operations. Created by Al Newkirk.

MongoDBx::Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDBx::Class <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBx::Class>`_ is an
ORM for MongoDB databases. MongoDBx::Class takes advantage of the fact
that Perl's MongoDB driver is Moose-based to extend and tweak the
driver's behavior, instead of wrapping it. This means MongoDBx::Class
does not define its own syntax, so you simply use it exactly as you
would the MongoDB driver directly. Created by Ido Perlmuter.

Other Perl Tools
----------------

BSON
~~~~

`BSON <https://metacpan.org/module/BSON>`_ is a pure-Perl BSON
implementation. Created by Stefan G.

Entities::Backend::MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Entities::Backend::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/Entities::Backend::MongoDB>`_
is a backend for the Entities user management and authorization system. It
stores all entities and relations between them in a MongoDB database. Created by
Ido Perlmuter.

MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB>`_
is a store for `MojoX::Session <https://metacpan.org/module/MojoX::Session>`_
that stores a session in a MongoDB database. Created by Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen.

MongoDB::Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB::Admin <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB::Admin>`_ is a
collection of MongoDB administrative functions. Created by David Burley.

MongoDBx::Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDBx::Queue <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBx::Queue>`_ is
a basic message queue system backed by MongoDB. Created by David Golden.

MongoX
~~~~~~

`MongoX <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoX>`_ is light wrapper for
MongoDB, providing some nice DSL sugar. Created by Pan Fan.

MooseX::Role::MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MooseX::Role::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::Role::MongoDB>`_
is a Moose role which provides connection management and automatic
fork handling for the MongoDB driver. Created by David Golden.

OOP Perl CMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`OOP Perl CMS <http://www.waitman.net/mod_perl-mongodb-CMS.html>`_ is
based on Khurt Williams' Object Oriented Perl methodology and can be
used as a basic CMS framework or as a basis for your own CMS system. It
uses Apache & mod_perl with MongoDB backend. Created by Waitman Gobble.
