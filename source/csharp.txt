Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB C#/.NET
driver. You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB
in C#/.NET. Download it using `NuGet <https://www.nuget.org/>`__ or
set up a runnable project by following our Getting Started guide.

- `Getting Started <{+csharp-docs-versioned+}/getting_started/>`__

- `API Reference <{+csharp-docs-versioned+}/apidocs/html/R_Project_CSharpDriverDocs.htm>`__

- `Changelog <{+csharp-docs-versioned+}/what_is_new/>`__

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver>`__

.. tip:: Use the MongoDB Analyzer

   The `MongoDB Analyzer <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/>`__
   is a tool for C#/.NET developers that helps you understand how your code
   translates into the MongoDB Query API and if your code includes unsupported
   LINQ or builder expressions.

Installation
------------

``NuGet`` is the simplest way to get the driver. Use
`MongoDB.Driver <https://www.nuget.org/packages/mongodb.driver>`__ for
all new projects.

For more information, see `Installation <{+csharp-docs-versioned+}/getting_started/installation/>`__.

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/atlas-connect-blurb.rst

.. code-block:: csharp

   using MongoDB.Bson;
   using MongoDB.Driver;

   // Replace the uri string with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   var client = new MongoClient(
       "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/test?w=majority"
   );
   var database = client.GetDatabase("test");

.. include:: /includes/serverless-compatibility.rst

See `Connecting <{+csharp-docs-versioned+}/reference/driver/connecting/>`__
for more information.

{+stable-api+}
--------------

You can use the {+stable-api+} feature starting with MongoDB Server version
5.0 and C#/.NET Driver version 2.13. When you use the {+stable-api+} feature,
you can update your driver or server without worrying about backward
compatibility issues with any commands covered by the {+stable-api+}.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

To use this feature, construct a MongoDB client instance, specifying a version
of the {+stable-api+}:

.. code-block:: csharp

   // Replace <connection string> with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   var settings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString("<connection string>");

   // Set the version of the {+stable-api+} on the client.
   settings.ServerApi = new ServerApi(ServerApiVersion.V1);
   var client = new MongoClient(settings);

See the MongoDB Server reference on the :manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>`
for more information.

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-csharp-driver>`
code example and run it.
