Deploying a MongoDB instance on `DigitalOcean <https://www.digitalocean.com/>`_
is simple with the MongoDB One-Click application. It allows you to spin up a
server with MongoDB pre-installed so you can get your application off the
ground quickly.

Launching a MongoDB Instance
----------------------------

You can launch a new MongoDB instance by selecting **MongoDB** from the
**Applications** tab on the Droplet create page:

.. image:: /images/digitalocean-control-panel.png

Once you have created your server, you can connect to it via the web-based
console in the DigitalOcean control panel or via SSH:

.. code-block:: sh

    ssh root@your.ip.address

Using the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One-Click Application images are also available via `DigitalOcean's RESTful
API <https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/>`_. Use the slug
(``"mongodb"``) rather than an ID when specifying the image to ensure you are
using the most up to date version.

The following example will launch a launch a 2 GB server with private networking
enabled, running MongoDB in the NYC3 region. Of course, remember to replace the
API access token with one of your own `obtained in the DigtialOcean control
panel <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2#how-to-generate-a-personal-access-token>`_.

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer b7d03a6947b217efb6f3ec3bd3504582' \
        -d '{"name":"shard-01.example.com", "region":"nyc3","size":"2gb", "image":"mongodb", "private_networking":true}' \
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"

Instance Details
----------------

The environment on your new server will consist of:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* MongoDB 3.x installed via Apt from the upstream repository

MongoDB will be available at port 27017 and is bound to the localhost by
default. Its data is stored in :file:`/var/lib/mongodb/`. You can view or
modify its configuration details in :file:`/etc/mongod.conf`.

To connect to the test database with the MongoDB shell, simply run:

.. code-block:: sh

    mongo

The daemon will be running by default and can be managed using the native
service commands, i.e.:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb restart

Additional Information
----------------------

The One-Click application simply provides you with MongoDB as a pre-installed
base. It's up to you how you want to use it. Whether you are building out a
sharded cluster or simply want to connect it to an app on the same host, the
DigitalOcean community has a number of tutorials which should point you in the
right direction:

* `How To Implement Replication Sets in MongoDB <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-replication-sets-in-mongodb-on-an-ubuntu-vps>`_
* `How To Create a Sharded Cluster in MongoDB <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sharded-cluster-in-mongodb-using-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps>`_
* `How To Connect Node.js to a MongoDB Database <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-node-js-to-a-mongodb-database-on-a-vps>`_

A `MEAN Stack One-Click application image <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-mean-one-click-install-image>`_
is also available. It provides Node.js, Express, and AngularJS pre-installed
along side of MongoDB.
