`Windows Azure VMs <https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/virtual-machines/>`_
allow you to deploy both Windows and Linux virtual machines to the
Windows Azure cloud service. These VMs are similar to local instances or
other IaaS services and hence can be used to run MongoDB instances.

To sign up, go to
`http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/virtual-machines/`_.

.. IMPORTANT TODO
   On the wiki, this topic had this outdated content:
   Sign up for ‘Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks’ preview feature from the new Azure portal*
   In the ‘Preview’ portal, go to Account->Preview Features.
   Sign up for the “Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks”
   “*” – The VM Role beta program from the old Azure portal (shown below) is not the same as the preview feature above

.. AND had these graphics (now in the eco/images dir), which also appear to be outdated:
