===============================
Configure Worker Roles on Azure
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The following are the configuration options available as part of the
MongoDB Worker Role.

MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDBRole configuration
----------------------------------------------

- ``Configuration`` tab

  - ``.Net Trust Level``: Ensure this is set to ``Full Trust``.

  - ``Instance count``: Set to the number of replica set members you
    require. Default is ``3``. Setting this to ``1`` would run a replica set
    with 1 instance (equivalent to stand alone).

  - ``VM Size``: Choose size of ``Medium`` or higher. The I/O
    characteristics of small or extra small instance make these
    configurations unsuitable for MongoDB.

- ``Settings`` tab

  - ``MongoDBDataDir``: Storage for MongoDB data files ``--dbpath``.
    Configure for development or deployment. Data files are in a
    subdirectory called ``data``. Default is local DevStorage.

  - ``MongoDBDataDirSizeMB``: Size of blob (in megabytes) allocated for
    MongoDB data directory. Default is 1 GB for the emulator and 100 GB
    for deployed.

  - ``ReplicaSetName``: Name of the MongoDB replica set. Default is ``rs``.
    This also serves as the blob container name.

  - ``MongoDBLogVerbosity``: Verbosity with which to start
    :program:`mongod`. Default is ``null``.

  - ``RecycleOnExit``: This dictates whether the worker role is recycled
    when MongoDB exits. Default is ``false``. Hence if the
    :program:`mongod` process exits, the worker role instance is still
    up.

  - ``Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString``:
    Storage for diagnostics information.

  .. TODO reinsert text when reinsert screenshot:
     The following image shows the settings required in a local context.

- ``Endpoints`` tab

  - ``MongodPort``: Port on which :program:`mongod` listens. Default is
    ``27017``. If running locally on the Azure emulator, this is port
    for the first instance that is started.

- Local Storage

  - ``MongoDBLocalDataDir``: This specifies the size of the local
    storage used as a cache for the Windows Azure Drive used as the
    MongoDB data directory. Larger sizes provide better read performance.

  - ``MongodLogDir``: Size of storage allocated for ``mongod.log``. Make
    this large enough depending on verbosity chosen and instance size.
    
    .. TODO reinsert this text when screenshot is reinserted:
       Use the default settings for local storage as specified below when
       running on the Azure emulator. When deploying to Azure, change local
       storage size based on instance size chosen.

  - ``BackupDriveCache``: Size of local storage used as cache during the
    backup process.
