.. default-domain:: mongodb

Modulus is a premier Node.js and MongoDB hosting platform that provides a 
complete technology stack for application developers. This includes custom SSL, 
WebSockets, statistics, and more.

MongoDB is available as a first class solution on the 
`Modulus platform <http://modulus.io>`. The platform supports easy managment 
tools to create databases, create and update users, and see in 
real-time how the database is performing.

Modulus supports replica sets on dedicated plans. This includes the ablity for 
Meteor users to have access to the oplog. To find out more about our dedicated 
plans, contact `sales <mailto:sales@modulus.io>`.

By providing both a place to run Node.js applications and MongoDB databases 
Modulus gives you a single place to handle all your platform needs. 
This means faster connections between your application and database, and 
less headache managing. This doesn't mean that you have to run your 
application on Modulus, you can choose any application platform you'd like.

If you need all this power and a dedicated environment, Modulus has your 
answer with `Curvature <http://curvature.io>`. You can get everything 
mentioned above with the flexibility of choosing where you run it. 
It could be on-premises, in a dedicated cloud, or a hybrid of the two.


Modulus Account Setup
----------------------------------------
If you don't have an account yet, go ahead and 
`create one <https://modulus.io/register>`.

Next go ahead and install the CLI (requires Node.js & NPM).

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install -g modulus

If you have any questions check out the `documentation first 
<https://modulus.io/codex/cli/using_the_cli>` and that doesn't get you 
there `contact us <https://modulus.io/contact>`.

Now make sure you're logged in.

.. code-block:: sh

   modulus login

Once logged in you're ready to go.

Create a Database
-----------------------

It's very simple to create a database on Modulus.

A couple commands and you're off and running.

.. code-block:: sh

   modulus mongo create "Database Name"
   Welcome to Modulus
   You are logged in as spiderman
   Creating MongoDB database Database Name
   [√] New MongoDB database Database Name created.
   Database available at: noveda.modulusmongo.net:27017/xxxxxxx

With the database created, a user needs created.

.. code-block:: sh

   Welcome to Modulus
   You are logged in as spiderman
   [?] Are you sure you want to use database Database Name? (yes)
   Selected MongoDB database Database Name.
   [?] Enter username: johnny
   [?] Enter password: five
   [?] Read only permissions? (yes) no
   [✓] New MongoDB database user johnny created.

The full mongo uri in this case is then.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodb://johnny:five@noveda.modulusmongo.net:27017/xxxxxxx

Databases can also be created through the web interface. 
Navigate to your User dashboard and select the Databases tab on the left.

To create a new database, click the "Create Database" button.

On this dialog, enter the desired label of the database. This name is simply 
a convenience label and is not the actual name of the database within Mongo. 
Actual database names are created automatically by Modulus. You can 
optionally create a read/write user at this stage. If you do not create a 
user now, you must create one later in order to access your database.

Once complete, the popup will change with information about your newly 
created database.

The Mongo URI can be used to connect to your database from your application. 
The Mongo Console is the command used to connect to your instance using 
`Mongo's command line tool 
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo>`. 
This information can also be retrieved at any time on the database dashboard.
