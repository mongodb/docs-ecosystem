.. note:: Placeholder Text

    You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
    your KMS configuration values.

    For example, the Node.js code prompts you to include a client ID value as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

       azure: {
         clientId: "<Azure client ID>"
         ...
       }

    If your Azure client ID is "12345678", you should substitute the text as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

       azure: {
         clientId: "12345678"
         ...
       }
