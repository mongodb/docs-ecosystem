.. note:: Placeholder Text

   You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
   your KMS configuration values.

   For example, the Node.js code prompts you to include a key ring value as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      masterKey: {
        keyRing: "<GCP key ring name>"
        ...
      }

   If your GCP key ring is "my-key-ring", you should substitute the text as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      masterKey: {
        keyRing: "my-key-ring"
        ...
      }
