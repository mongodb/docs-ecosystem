.. note:: Placeholder Text

    You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with

    .. code-block:: javascript

        email: "<GCP service account email>"
    
    Your GCP service accoutn email is "someEmail@email.com", you should
    replace the text in the following code snippet as follows: 

    .. code-block:: javascript

        email: "someEmail@email.com"
