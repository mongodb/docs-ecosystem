.. note:: Placeholder Text

    You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
    your KMS configuration values. 

    For example, the Node.js code prompts you to include an email as
    follows: 

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

        email: "<GCP service account email>"
    
    If your GCP service account email is "someEmail@email.com", you should
    substitute the text as follows: 

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

        email: "someEmail@email.com"
