.. note:: Placeholder Text

    You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
    your KMIP provider configuration values.

    For example, the Java code prompts you to include a KMIP provider URI
    as follows:

    .. code-block:: java
       :copyable: false

       providerDetails.put("endpoint", "<KMIP provider URI>");

    If your KMIP provider URI is "localhost:5696", substitute
    the text as follows:

    .. code-block:: java
       :copyable: false

       providerDetails.put("endpoint", "localhost:5696");
