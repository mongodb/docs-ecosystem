.. note:: Placeholder Text

   You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
   your KMS configuration values.

   For example, the Node.js code prompts you to include a key name value
   as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      azure: {
        keyName: "<Azure key name>"
        ...
      }

   If your Azure master key name is "my-key-name", you should substitute the
   text as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      azure: {
        keyName: "my-key-name"
        ...
      }
