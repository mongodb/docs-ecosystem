.. note:: Placeholder Text

    You must substitute all text in quotes and angle brackets with
    your KMS configuration values.

    For example, the Node.js code prompts you to include a private key value as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

        privateKey: "<GCP service account private key>"

    If your GCP service account private key is "s-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-private-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\",
    you should substitute the text as follows:

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

        privateKey: "your-private-key"
